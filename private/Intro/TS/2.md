Hi guys! Did you know that English prepositions are really different from Indonesian prepositions? What makes them different is the ways English speakers see and observe locations. In other words, we do not see and observe locations like English speakers do. So, if we want to learn English prepositions, we should learn the ways they see and observe. To do this, we can use schemas. 

Schemas represent meaning in space and time. 

For example, look at the following schema for the word in as in "Josh is getting out of the room."
In a schema, there is a landmark (LM) which is bigger and less moveable (the circle in the example) and a trajector (TR) which is smaller and more moveable (the circle in the example).

In the sentence Josh is getting out of the room, the landmark (LM) is the room. The trajector (TR) is Josh. 

The preposition out is used to show that the TR (Josh) exits the LM (the room).
