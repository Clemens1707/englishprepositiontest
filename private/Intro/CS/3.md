In this tutor, we will help you learn the prepositions in, on and at. In Indonesian, we can use di, di atas, or di dalam. But in, on and at are not exactly the same with di, di atas, and di dalam. Here are the 5 schemas of in, on, and at that you will learn in this tutor so that you can learn to see and perceive like English native speakers do.

If you haven’t remembered the 5 schemas above, it’s okay. During this online lesson, we will explain how sentences match the schemas. We hope the schemas and the explanations in the lesson can help you remember and make better prepositional decisions.
