A special way that we train English prepositions is to use **_schemas_**. Schemas are abstract patterns that represent meaning in space and time. For example, look at the following schema for the word __out__ as in John went out of the room.

In a schema, there is a spatially stable __landmark__ (the circle in the example) and a moving __trajector__ (the dot in the example). Out is used when the trajector exits the landmark.

In the sentence John went __out__ of the room, the landmark is the room. The trajector is John. The preposition out means that John exits the room.
